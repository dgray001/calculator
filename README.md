Calculator pet project to learn the Go language and sharpen basic interpreter skills (tokenize, parse, evaluate)

v0.0q: Test user input

Plans:
 - v0.1: Basic Operations
    r: Can toggle debug mode
    s: Integer multiplication
    t: Functions parsed
    u: Functions evaluated (increment, decrement, abs)
    v: Brackets must close on same type
    w: Test complex inputs => more functions
 - v0.2: Rational Numbers / Division
   - RationalNumbers struct (two int structs)
   - Add / subtract rational numbers
   - Multiply rational numbers
   - Division token turns ints into rational numbers
   - Rational numbers auto-simplify => can turn into an int
   - Absolute value function
   - Factorial operator
 - v0.3: Irrational Numbers / Roots
 - v0.4: Limits
 - v0.5: Derivatives
 - v0.6: Integrals
 - v0.7: Imaginary Numbers / Trigonometry
